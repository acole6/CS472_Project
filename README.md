CS472_Project
=============

Need to do
- Add shoot decision to try to kill wumpus
- clean up gui to make it look and work better
- make a hero that uses DFS, BFS and one of those but with a heuristic. Only one hero class should be needed to implement all of these and which type of search that is done is given in the constructor
- methods where Hero and GameBoard interact may need to be modified to better suit the Hero class that uses search AI
- Add dropdown to GUI to select an AI
- Add button on GUI to put the GUI at its initial state so that a new grid and AI can be selected
