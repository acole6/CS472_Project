CS472_Project
=============

We implemented a simplified version of Wumpus World that uses search algoriithms to find a path to the gold and back. The main classes to look at are AbstractHero, BreadthSearchHero, Cell, DepthSearchHero, GameBoard, HeuristicHero and Test. The hero classes extend AbstractHero and take in a GameBoard to solve. The Test class shows the results of each of the search heroes on grids of varying sizes. 

The gui code can mostly be ignored as it was designed for a knowledge-based hero agent that we did not completely flesh out.
